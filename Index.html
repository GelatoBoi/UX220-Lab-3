        Personally, the best movie that I've watched recently is a bollywood movie named "Hum Tum," literally meaning "We and you."
        The movie starts with the male and female main characters meeting each other for the first time at an airport before they head off internationally for university. The viewer quickly realizes that the man is a very flirtatious personality with no sense of commitment, while the woman is a very upheld and honorable personality. Initially during the start of this unique relationship, every time these two met Every now and then, they couldn't stand each other and were highly annoyed by one another. However, after certain events, the two Come to be on good terms with each other and being friends. Towards the climax of the movie, their attempts to help one another ended up becoming mutual, with both having feelings for one another. Of course, the plot obviously has a lot of twists and The movie highlights some interesting and funny takes on the relationship between men and women.
