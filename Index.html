        The Best Thing I've Read: by Areeb Mohsin 
    </h1>

    <p> Personally, the best book that I've read recently in a 
        long time was Advanced Functions 12: Study Guide and 
        University Handbook. Written by Laurissa Werhun and 
        Paula Thiessen. 
    </p>

        This book has a special place in my heart, as 
        it was the one of the few books in my life that 
        brought out the most emotion in me.  
    </p>

    <p> 
        Most high schools students can also agree with my sentiment
        for this piece of literature. I hope that many other future 
        generations of students may also experience the wonderful 
        journey this book brings readers on.
